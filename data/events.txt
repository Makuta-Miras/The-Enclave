	planet "New Asgard"		
		description `New Asgard is a relatively small moon, although despite this it is still able to hold onto a thick, breathable atmosphere. Much of the moon is desert, although some areas near the highest mountains do receive enough rain to allow them to become well-forested. The oceans here have enormous tide differences due to the gas giant above, and as a result, most seaside settlements are practically built inside glass domes reinforced with titanium so that they can survive the inrush of water at high tide.`
		description `	Despite the relative absence of natural resources, New Asgard is still fairly rich due to the tourism industry- many people come here simply to experience the awe of waking up to see the face of a gas giant staring down at them.`
		spaceport `The spaceport is a slick, clean and modern, with hallways paved in dark granite and arching roofs overhead. Most of the terminal is taken up by small stores and off-licenses.`
		spaceport `	The entire spaceport seems to be filled with people with cameras, hysterically barging their way through the crowds to find their ride off of this moon.`
	planet Jumblar
		description `Now that war has truly begun, the production of warships on this planet appears to have been increased tenfold; every few minutes, a gleaming, new ship flies overhead, arriving at the spaceport to join up with the main fleets.`

	planet Carmine
		description `Many of Carmine's largest cities have been nuked to oblivion by XSZ's forces. While there is still some of the old infrastructure around, the planet is, for the most part, now devoid of a lot of the basic necessities to allow humans to live comfortably.`
		spaceport `The spaceport is no longer in existence. It was one of XSZ's first targets in the nuclear attack, and as a result the area has been entirely flattened. It seems that a number of tanks of deuterium hyperspace fuel that were housed at the spaceport were ruptured during the blast; fires now rage constantly in the spaceport's remains.`

	planet Alleshafen
		description `Like Carmine, Alleshafen bore the brunt of a large number of nuclear attacks. As a result, while it has not been decimated as completely as Carmine was- especially in the shipbuilding areas- the environment on Alleshafen will continue to be in a dire state thanks to the radiation from the nuclear blasts until well after you are dead.`
		spaceport `The spaceport is relatively unscathed; the only marks of battle on it are frequent burns on the walls, clearly from lasers, and the absence of one of the main terminals; you suspect it was destroyed by sustained particle fire.`

	planet Arikv
		description `Arikv was settled only fairly recently, according to the locals- the terraforming process is still continuing, which explains the humid conditions, and a decent part of the planet is still uncharted.`
		description ` However, this planet still boasts a shipyard and a comprehensive outfitter- doubtless due to its strategic position between XSZ and Enclave territory. It appears that the recent XSZ attack against Arikv was, in fact, repulsed successfully; the same cannot be said for the neighbouring systems.`
